# Pico-ade-Machine
A physical pico 8 emulator with 17 push buttons, 2 joysticks, Pi pico zero 2 w, tft display and 3 orpheus pico.  

# CAD MODEL
Fitting everything without over-modeling it, thi was done so it-s tiny enough to be lightweight and have a fast 3d printing. You can always download the Fusion project file and modify as you wish.

# CARDBOARD CASE 
Due to taking to long on making the CAD, we didn't got to 3d print it, but that doesn't mean it's over, it can also mean diy + art!
